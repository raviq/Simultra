## Description

Simultra is an open-source, hybrid road traffic simulator designed to handle large roadmaps in real-time. It combines microscopic and mesoscopic simulations into one multiagent hybrid simulator. The large-scale maps are modelled mesoscopically in real-time, and the complex traffic interactions benefit from detailed agent-based microscopic simulations. To resolve the concurrency issues within the maps representation and the meso-micro transitions, Simultra combines an event-based mesoscopic model of the maps with a more detailed physical engine.

### Features

- Programmable agents that can emulate vehicles, drivers and intelligent traffic signals.
- Realistic map rendering using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
- Precipitation rendering on top of the traffic simulation layer.

To build MapGraphics and generate `libMapGraphics` run

```sh
cd mapgraphics/
qmake MapGraphics.pro
make
```

To build simultra run

```sh
qmake simultra.pro
make
```

## Usage

To configure and run a simulation you need to work on a number of files in `config/`.

- Start by downloading the map of the area you are interested in from [osm.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=18/35.17126/136.90116&layers=C) and name it `map.osm` .
- Set the map topology in `simx_map.xml`.
- Set the simulation scenario in `simx_simulation.xml` by specifying the vehicles and itineraries:

For each vehicle, we need to specify an XML entry:


```
<Vehicle type="TypeX">
  <Location>450 440</Location>
  <Direction>0</Direction>
  <Driver type="Slow1">
    <Lane>
      <Intersections>A B C D E</Intersections>
    </Lane>
  </Driver>
</Vehicle>
```

which contains the initial position of the vehicle, its orientation, driver type, and the intersections that define the itinerary of the driver.


- Set the types of the vehicles and the divers in `types.xml`.
An example of vehicle type specifies the mass, wheelbase, force, and the look of the vehicle:
```
<VehicleType name="TypeX">
  <Image>:/images/bluecar.png</Image>
  <Mass>1800.0</Mass>
  <Wheelbase>1</Wheelbase>
  <MotForce>5000</MotForce>
</VehicleType>
```

The driver type specifies the velocities of two angles (straight and turn) which will later be used in the behavioural model. Example:
```
<DriverType name="SlowType">
  <TurnVelocity>2</TurnVelocity>
  <StraightVelocity>12</StraightVelocity>
</DriverType>
```

- Set the radar images in `RadarImages/` for the precipitation simulation. Current build comes with examples of `.gif` images from the [Japan Meteorological Agency](https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html). 

- It is important to set some of the parameters in `config.h`.

Now, running the simulator should give something like:

### What you can do
- Zoom in/out, either with the mouse or button 6.
- Drag the map in different directions by clicking on button 11 and using the mouse.
- Start the simulation using button 1.
- Go through the mobility data in area 19.
- Set zoom scale to 6 and press button 12 to see how precipitation clusters change on top of the map.
- Press button 13 to shown some information about Simultra.
- Alternate layers in area 15 using the up and down buttons.

etc.

## Integration in other projects

Simultra was used in other project either directly or after some changes on its design and code.

- As a pipelined distributed architecture ([project](https://github.com/itolab-hayashi-rafik/Simultra))

## Improvements

- There are currently too many configuration files. They can be either generated automatically in a pre-simulation phase or integrated in one JSON file (`config.h` too). Another way to avoid the heavy configuration is to randomly assign vehicles to the existing (OSM) paths. The assignments could be parametrised using some vehicle-per-lane distribution. Another option is to drag and drop vehicles on the OSM map.
- Integrate traffic lights with OSM maps.
- The precipitation data could in principle be acquired dynamically using some weather API.
- Improvements on the (lat, lon) from/to (x, y) conversions.
- Combining `readosm` and `json.c`.
- More testing..
